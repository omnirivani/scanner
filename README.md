## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing modules, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
- Sometimes a search query will not return a result, even though that card technically exists in TCGplayer. 
      - This is because TCGplayer may move product listings around randomly.
      - As this program checks a specified number of pages, the card of interest may be placed in a deeper page.
      - Rerunning the query can fix this issue.
- If you encounter any bugs or errors, please let me know so I can fix them. Contact: omnirivani@gmail.com
